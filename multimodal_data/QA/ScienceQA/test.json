He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\r\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\r\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.", "answer_text": "how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour", "answer_index": 1}

However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\r\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past.

(d) The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.", "context": "Read the text about cats.\r\nCats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\r\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\r\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\r\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!", "answer_text": "The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice.", "answer_index": 2}

(b) They can communicate about specific problems. (c) They can understand some human speech.", "context": "Read the text about bats.\r\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\r\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\r\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\r\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.", "answer_text": "They can communicate about specific problems.", "answer_index": 1}
