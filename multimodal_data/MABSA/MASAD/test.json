in catalonia , whose capital is barcelona , on st george s day , gifts are exchanged between sweethearts a rose to the woman , a book to the man . this day is also called the day of lovers . the roses are given in memory of st jordi , who rescued a princess from the dragon he slew . the blood spilt from the dragon grew into a rose that jordi gave to the rescued princess , a symbol of love and friendship , or at least so they tell me . books started being given on st jordi s day from 1923 when a barcelona bookseller started the custom to help sell books , using as a hook the death date of two famous great writers on 23rd april 1616 spain s miguel cervantes , author of don quixote , and england s william shakespeare . 23rd april has also been designated international book day by unesco . it is estimated that 6 million roses and 400 , 000 books ( half catalonia s yearly book sales ) are sold in barcelona on st george s day . note that devoted sons may buy their mother a pot of orchids or other flowers instead . tradicionalmente en catalu a la diada de sant jordi como es conocido este d a all , es el d a de los enamorados , en el cual las personas intercambian y regalan rosas y libros a su pareja y personas queridas . se cree que la tradici n de regalar en esta fecha una rosa a la mujer amada se remonta probablemente hasta el siglo xv . algunas versiones hacen coincidir esta pr ctica con la feria de las rosas o de los enamorados que ten a lugar en barcelona durante el verano . es un hecho constatado que en aquella poca ya se repart an rosas a las mujeres que asist an a la misa oficiada en la capilla de san jorge del palacio de la generalidad de catalu a en esta fecha . la rosa va acompa ada de una senyera y una espiga de trigo . el color rojo de la rosa simboliza la pasi n , la senyera al patr n de catalu a y la espiga de trigo representa la fertilidad . el d a de sant jordi tiene un aspecto reinvindicativo de la cultura catalana y muchos balcones lucen la bandera aut noma , la senyera . en toda catalu a se venden cromos y llaveros llegando a su m xima expresi n en las ramblas , donde a los puestos habituales se a aden temporales . es tradicional promover la venta de libros con firmas de los autores y un descuento al precio de venta . normalmente tambi n se realizan actividades en las bibliotecas y conciertos en las calles que se a aden a la agenda cultural de la ciudad condal .", "image": "multimodal_data/MABSA/MASAD/image_data/test_image/3523837092.jpg", "aspect": "street", "label": "negative"}

{"index": "5419813866", "text": "from a href http www . hauntedcastlesandhotels . com ireland leap . htm rel noreferrer nofollow www . hauntedcastlesandhotels . com ireland leap . htm a leap castle has a violent and turbulent history , a keep castle , it was built in the 14th or 15th century to guard the pass from slieve bloom into munster . this fortress is considered ireland 's most haunted castle , haunted by the type of spirit called an quot elemental quot . it is a frighting and horrifying apparition , it 's hauntings bring on an overwhelming sense of dread and deep rooted fear . those who have experienced it describe a hideous looking quot thing quot with almost human looking eyes and reeks of the most ghastly odor . history the galic name for the castle is quot leim ui bhanain quot , which means the leap of the o'bannons . under the o'carroll chiefs , the o'bannon clan were the first owners of leap castle , later occupied by the o'carroll 's themselves . from here the o'carroll 's would set out for victory and defeat , and here they would bring thier brides and there captives . leap was an impregnable fortress impervious to attack . in 1513 , leap castle was attacked by gerald fitzgerald , but was not taken . gerald og fitzgerald of kildore attacked the castle in 1516 . in 1557 during an attack led by the earl of sussex , the o'carroll 's made a successful escape . in 1604 or 1605 , some of ely o'carroll 's territory was attached to kings county which is now offaly . it is rumored that the daughter of an o'carroll helped the escape of a darby from leap castle and later married him . after the failure of the revolt of the earls , in 1619 the plantation of ely o'carroll took place . along with the english rulers , loyal protestant scots and englishmen settled into the area depriving the local galic population of their land . leap castle then passed into the hands of the darby family . after this many darbys became high sheriff of kings county . the most famous darby is admiral sir henry darby who fought at the battle of the nile and escorted napolean bonaparte into exile after leaving france . the elemental over 400 years ago in what is now known as the quot bloody chapel quot a shocking murder occured . leap castle was then a stronghold of the o'carroll family , powerful irish princes , chieftains of the area . in 1532 , on the death of the o'carroll chieftain , a fierce rivalary for the leadership errupted within the family . the bitter fight for power turned brother against brother . one of the brothers was a priest . the o'carroll priest was holding mass for a group of his family ( in what is now called the quot bloody chapel quot ) . while chanting the holy rites , his rival brother burst into the chapel plunging his sword into his brother . fatally wounding him , the butchered priest fell across the altar and died in front of his family . the henious act of brother killing brother and the blasphemy of a sacred mass cut short by such an evil event sent an echo of misery ringing thoughout the castle . another source of evil was found at leap castle that may have compounded and nutured the spirt of the elemental . a hidden ubliet ( a dungeon ) was found off the bloody chapel . it was a small room with a drop floor . those who were forgotten within this room suffered unimaginable pain and misery until their death . prisoners would be pushed into the room to fall through the floor and land on a spike eight feet below . if you were not lucky enough to die quickly on the spike , you died of starvation in a doorless room while the aroma of food and the sounds of merriment drifted up from the rooms below . a narrow window would let you watch those who came and went in freedom from the castle . around c . 1900 workmen who where hired to clean out the ubliet made a hideous discovery , human skeletons laid piled on top of each other . it took three full cart loads to remove all of the bones . among the bones workmen found a pocket watch made in the 1840 's . it is not certain if the dungeon was still in use then . because of its extremely bloody history leap castle has always had a reputation of being haunted , a reputation so strong local people avoided it at night . completely gutted by fire , leap castle was boarded up and it 's gates were pad locked for over 70 years . locals have described seeing the windows at the top of the castle quot light up for a few seconds as if many candles were brought into the room quot late at night . the castle laid in ruin for years . shortly after leap 's dungons gruesome discovery , a psychic disturbance may have caused the emergence of the elemental spirit . in 1659 ownership of leap castle passed in marrage from the o'carroll family to an english family , the darbys . the darby family turned leap into their family home , with improvements and additions and landscaped gardens . in the late 19th century descendants johanthan and mildred darby were looking forward to raising their family here . the occult was the fashion of the day , and mildred darby did some innocent dabbling , despite the castle 's history and reputation for being haunted . mildred 's dabbling with magic awakened the elemental with ferocious velocity . in 1909 , mildred darby wrote an atricle for the journal occult review , describing her terrifying ordeal . quot i was standing in the gallery looking down at the main floor , when i felt somebody put a hand on my shoulder . the thing was about the size of a sheep . thin guanting shadowy . . . , it 's face was human , to be more accurate inhuman . its lust in its eyes which seemed half decomposed in black cavities stared into mine . the horrible smell one hundred times intensified came up into my face , giving me a deadly nausea . it was the smell of a decomposing corpse . the elemental is thought to be a premative ghost that attaches itself to a particular place . it is often malevolent , terrifying and unpredictable . after mrs . darby 's experiments in the black arts , leap castle has never been the same . hauntings plague leap leaving a sinister air throughout the castle . the darbys remained at leap until 1922 . being the home of an english family , it became the target of the irish struggle for independence . destroyed by bombs , completely looted , nothing but a burned out shell remained . the darby 's were driven out . in the 1970 's leap castle was purchased by an australian , who had a white witch brought in from mexico to exorcise the castle . she spent many hours in the bloody chapel , when she emerged she explained that the spirits at leap castle were no longer malevolent , but they wished to remain . in the 1990 's the castle was sold to the current owners . they were aware of the castle 's troubled history . shortly after moving in they began restoration of the castle . during which time a quot freak accident quot left the owner with a broken kneecap delaying restoration work on the castle for nearly a year . one year after his quot accident quot the owner was back at work restoring his castle when the ladder he was standing on suddenly tilted backwards away from the wall causing him to jump several stories resulting in a broken ankle . both were strange accidents . the owners say they would be happy to share the castle with the spirits as long as there are no more quot occurrences quot . in 1991 , in leap castle 's bloody chapel was the christening of the owner 's baby daughter . for the first time in centuries the quot bloody chapel quot was filled with music , dancing , laughter , and most of all love . the day had been a quot happy , pleasant , wonderful day quot . if the troubled spirits of leap castle did not leave , maybe they have finally found some peace .", "image": "multimodal_data/MABSA/MASAD/image_data/test_image/5419813866.jpg", "aspect": "castle", "label": "negative"}

{"index": "4858981501", "text": "one of the great sights of the forests of eastern australia is happening right now . the australian red cedar is coming into new leaf . a deciduous mahogany which has a month or so without leaves in the dead of winter . around 150 years ago , men used to climb hills and mountains , and look below for the tell tale sign of new red or red orange growth of this plant . then they would plan to travel through the forests and cut down the red cedars . the lightweight reddish brown timber was prized for cabinet making , railway timber , boat building , turnery , parquetry , and so many other uses . some as ordinary as toilet seats and roofing . now , red cedar , i a href http plantnet . rbgsyd . nsw . gov . au cgi bin nswfl . pl ? page nswfl amp lvl sp amp name toona ciliata rel nofollow toona ciliata a i is considered the same species that grows in norfolk island , pakistan , new guinea , india and right down the south east coast of australia to near ulladulla . the southern most limit of distribution is apparently near the village of turmeil on the south coast of new south wales . it 's growing on basalt based soils west of the princes highway . in the mid 20th century , the cedar king of kempsey , bill haydon ran a lumber company in the mid north coast of new south wales . he made a good living exploring the ranges and the lowlands , cutting out red cedar . some of these trees were giants . several metres wide at the base . forty , fifty and more metres tall . trees over a thousand years old . there 's stories of monumental red cedar trees back of kempsey , now long gone . huge trees , majestic giants . who knows how tall they were , or how old they were . in april 1965 bill haydon disappeared in the wilderness of eastern australia . his remains were never found . his quest was to find red cedar , and cut them down and sell them for railway timber . that is for the insides of carriages . of internal paneling of trains . i 've traveled in them , and they are great carriages indeed . beautiful internal woodwork , a pale reddish colour . and on the walls of the train were black amp white photos of new south wales . great pictures to see , one i recall was the photo of mount warning , up in the far north east of the state . today , there is a stand of eleven red cedar at washpool national park . this is the last big stand . i the last big stand i of australian red cedar . perhaps , these were the trees that bill searched for . maybe his bones are nearby that stand of trees , maybe five miles away . it 's likely we will never know what happened to him . throughout the rainforests of eastern australia , the australian red cedar are waking from their winter sleep . now , the new leaves are engorged by fluid , they are spreading out , rich and red in their new colours . such as in this photo . the photo was taken at the a href http en . wikipedia . org wiki allyn river rel nofollow allyn river a in the barrington tops region of new south wales . the sub tropical rainforest by the allyn river is of some merit . such a diversity of many interesting plants . laurels , myrtles , figs and so many more . there 's large trees of varying types here . particularly the figs and a big rosewood . the big fig is 56 metres tall , it 's huge . logging at the allyn river started as early as the 1820s . the target was this tree , the australian red cedar . after recent rain , the allyn river is pouring down the valley slopes , and rushing through the agricultural land , on a journey to the sea .", "image": "multimodal_data/MABSA/MASAD/image_data/test_image/4858981501.jpg", "aspect": "plant", "label": "positive"}

{"index": "6163280595", "text": "history of peckerwood garden john g . fairey thirty years ago i came to texas to teach first year design in the school of architecture at texas a amp m university and in 1971 purchased the land that forms the nucleus of my garden . the site with its clear , spring fed brook reminded me of quot magical places quot in south carolina where i grew up and what began innocently , as a pursuit of a sense of place , fast evolved into a passion . this enthusiasm continues unchecked , and the garden is still evolving on a site that has grown to almost 40 acres and abounds with new projects and purpose . there are many ways to describe peckerwood garden it is a collection of more than 3 , 000 plants including many rarities it is a conservation garden containing examples of numerous threatened species , many of which are no longer found in the wild it is a laboratory garden testing a wide range of quot new quot plants and our mexican discoveries . it is a garden with a mission to encourage other gardeners to see a beauty in landscape that is consistent with our plants and climate it is a pioneering garden exploring new plants and cultivation methods and aesthetic concepts for other gardeners . it is a garden that looks to the future , not to the past . yet , most essential , it is my studio , a place where artistic and horticultural research are fused to create an environment that stimulates all of the senses , including the most elusive of all , our sense of time . my background and education as a painter have trained me to see the garden as an ever changing interaction of texture , color , rhythm , and space it is a series of rooms constructed with a wide variety of plant material in which trees , shrubs , light , shade , paths , steps , and water create and balance the composition . . . spaces created are arranged so that when walking , one catches glimpses of other spaces there is not a beginning or ending but a progressive journey of discovery . peckerwood historical photoa tornado destroyed the high canopy of giant , old trees in 1983 . in hindsight , the devastation provided the opportunity to explore new directions in the garden that better reflected my ideas about space and to investigate and experiment with new plant material . at this time i was joined in this enterprise by carl schoenfeld , and we started researching native plants and their mexican and asian counterparts in the garden . the constant pursuit of new plants for the garden design has kept us aware of the need to evolve the garden continuously . with each addition and change , new problems arise to be solved , resulting in the evolution of the garden both visually and conceptually . renowned plantsman and native plant explorer , lynn lowrey ( whose death was a keenly felt loss ) introduced me to my first texas native plant and for 25 years lent me his support and knowledge . it was lynn who in 1988 invited us to join him on a botanizing trip in the mountains of northern mexico . now veterans of about 100 expeditions to diverse remote regions of mexico , we are striving to document and conserve a rapidly vanishing uncatalogued matrix of beautiful and uniquely diversified mexican plants . our goal is to provide a cultural bridge between mexico and the united states and , we hope , raise awareness on both sides of the border about the richness of this horticultural trove and the threat of its irrevocable loss due to overgrazing and other growing economic pressures . we feel strongly about conservation work . in order for these extraordinary plants to be fully appreciated , they must be brought to the attention of the public . plant tag graveyardthe best way to achieve this is to share plant material and information with other public institutions . germplasm collected from these mexican expeditions as well as the results of plant testing in the garden were shared with arboreta and interested plant societies . in the early 1990 's , doctor j . c . raulston , director , north carolina state arboretum ( now j . c . raulston arboretum ) distributed in one year alone over 9 , 000 plants grown from seed that we shared with him . the best of these plants are beginning to make their way into the nursery trade and individual gardens . the urgency value of the mexican plant exploration has been a major factor in motivating me to donate my garden to the people of texas . it is the beginning of a new level of sharing , both the garden and its new plants , with an ever wider constituency . energy can now be directed to plant research in collaboration with an expanded group of participating institutions . in this way , i hope , the garden and the program to seek out and test new plants will continue into the next century . in this world of overemphasized technology in which values are often based on the superficial , gardens are a must for the public . they reacquaint us with the natural world , with our individual and shared past they bring healing , literally and figuratively , to many of our ills .", "image": "multimodal_data/MABSA/MASAD/image_data/test_image/6163280595.jpg",

{"index": "2877197638", "text": "greystones ( irish na clocha liatha ) is a coastal town in county wicklow , ireland . it is located on ireland s east coast , 8 km ( 5 miles ) south of bray and 27 km ( 17 mi ) south of dublin ( it is within the greater dublin area ) , with a population in the region of 15 , 000 . the town s name is derived from a one kilometre stretch of coastal grey rocks situated between two beaches this rocky area is known as the sea front . the harbour area and the railway station are at the northern and southern ends respectively . the north beach , which begins at the harbour , is a stony beach and some of its length is overlooked by the southern cliffs of bray head , which are subject to erosion . the south beach is a broad expansive sandy beach about one kilometre long . it was a blue flag beach and receives many visitors and tourists , mainly in the summer . the town is bordered by the irish sea to the east , bray head to the north and the wicklow mountains to the west . greystones is located south of the site of an ancient castle of the barony of rathdown . there was a hamlet which , like the castle , was known as rathdown , and which appeared on a 1712 map . this site occupied an area now known as the grove , about a quarter mile north of greystones harbour , but only the ruins of a chapel , st . crispin 's cell , survive . greystones is a much more recent settlement and is first mentioned in topographia hibernica , a 1795 publication . here it is described as a noted fishing place four miles beyond bray . in the early 1800s , there were some families scattered around the harbour , blacklion , windgates , killincarrig and rathdown . delgany was a more substantial and longer established village . however , greystones was put on the map with the coming of the railway in 1855 , a difficult undertaking which was performed in consultation with isambard kingdom brunel , the famous engineer . the train station was built on the line dividing the properties of two landowners the la touche family of bellevue house ( now in ruins , near delgany ) , and the hawkins whitshed family of killincarrig house ( which is now greystones golf club ) . it provided links with bray and dublin , and left room for development on the adjoining estates . in the latter half of the nineteenth century , under the ownership of william robert la touche , greystones' development gathered momentum . to the north of the station , church road , victoria road , and trafalgar road were laid out and many houses were built in the years following the arrival of the railway . following her father 's death , elizabeth hawkins whitshed was the sole inheritor of his property . in 1879 , she married frederick gustavus burnaby a soldier , politician and traveller . burnaby died in battle in 1885 and elizabeth remarried twice , but the property continued to be known as the burnaby estate . in the early 1900s , the burnabys began to expand the town on their side of the station , and the roads and houses of the burnaby were developed and the population grew considerably . the names of these two families remain well known today , with many roads and housing estates bearing their names . between 1885 and 1897 , the people of greystones campaigned for a harbour to aid the fishing industry and imports such as coal . the pier , dock , sea wall and boat slip remain but have endured substantial damage . in the early 1900s , the town felt the effects of coastal erosion ( which is still a major problem ) the loss of fields and most of the houses on the north beach road , and the costly inland relocation of the railway have all resulted . in 1968 , the old kish lighthouse foundation was added to the end of the pier . at the end of world war ii , cars and petrol became widely available , allowing greystones to gradually expand , filling in the space between itself and outlying areas such as blacklion , killincarrig , and delgany . however , the popularity of the railway declined its very existence being in jeopardy during the 1980s , as government cutbacks reduced the service to just a few trains per day . the 1990s brought a revival of sorts with the arrival of the electrified dart from bray , and a much more frequent schedule . greystones has experienced a huge increase in its population since the 1970s with the construction of several large housing estates . a new development at charlesland , just south of the town , includes over 1 , 000 dwelling units . as of the 2006 census the population of greystones , including town and environs , stands at 14 , 569 making it the second largest town in the county after bray . along with the housing developments , road networks and facilities have been improved to cater for the growth . the road between greystones and bray has been widened and realigned . a new dual carriageway link road ( r774 ) connecting greystones to the n11 has been completed . construction of a full interchange with the n11 is under way . according to the 2006 census , greystones has the largest church of ireland presence as a proportion of the population ( 9 . 77 ) .", "image":
