5,Which of the following could Gordon's test show?,/data/xiaocui/code/MMBigBench/multimodal_data/QA/ScienceQA/image_data/test_image/5/image.png,"['if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour', 'how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour', 'whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour']","People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.
The passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.

Gordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.
So, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.
Figure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.",how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour,1,-1,nan,"Gordon's test could show whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would be stable or unstable at various speeds, such as 200, 400, or 600 km/h. In the image, the parachute with a 1 m vent is suspended in the air, and a rocket is nearby. By analyzing the behavior of the parachute in the wind tunnel, researchers can determine how well it would perform during a spacecraft's descent, helping to ensure the safety and efficiency of the landing process.

11,What is the name of the colony shown?,/data/xiaocui/code/MMBigBench/multimodal_data/QA/ScienceQA/image_data/test_image/11/image.png,"['Maryland', 'New Hampshire', 'Rhode Island', 'Vermont']",,New Hampshire,1,-1,nan,"The answer to the question is ""b. New Hampshire."" As shown in the image, New Hampshire is the only colony located entirely within the green border, which represents the state boundaries in the map. The other colonies, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Vermont, have portions of their territories within the green border, but New Hampshire is the only one that is entirely enclosed by the marked boundary.
